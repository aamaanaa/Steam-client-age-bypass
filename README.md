## Steam age bypass for the desktop client
Steam often asks users to verify their age when accessing mature-rated games in the Store. This tool automatically bypasses that prompt, saving a fixed birthdate so you won't need to re-enter itâ€”even after restarting the client. For legal reasons, Steam does not store the entered age.

## Usage
> Make sure **Steam is completely closed** before running.

> Flatpak installations are currently **untested**.

> Please note that no user interaction is required. It will perform the bypass as soon you run it.
